# corner_hist

Creates corner plots similar to [the corner module](https://github.com/dfm/corner.py) which are a great way
to view MCMC chains for example.

Here, instead of giving data points, an already created histogram is put in.
This can be useful when only multidimensional histograms are available and we
quickly need to view all the 1D and 2D marginalizations.
